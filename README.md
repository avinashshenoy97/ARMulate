# ARMulate
Software that simulates the working of an ARM processor to a certain degree.

The application is written using web technologies and run using nw, formerly known as node-webkit. It is based on `Chromium` and `node.js`.

## To test ARMulate :
##### Clone the repo :
	git clone https://github.com/avinashshenoy97/ARMulate

##### Get NW.js (built using v0.22.3)
	https://nwjs.io/downloads/

##### Run the app
	cd /path/to/app/
	/path/to/nw .

/path/to/nw is the path to the binary file of NW.js.

On Winodws, it's `nw.exe`;
On Linux, it's `nw`;
On Mac, it's `nwjs.app/Contents/MacOS/nwjs`
